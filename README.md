# To-Do List App with React and Local Storage
Manage your tasks with ease using this to-do list application built with React and powered by local storage for data persistence.

**Project Description**  

This to-do list app is designed to simplify task management. It allows you to add, edit, and delete them while ensuring your to-do list is automatically saved to local storage for continued access even after closing your browser.

**Features**

Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.<br>
Edit Tasks: Update task descriptions as needed.<br>
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks when they're no longer needed.<br>
Local Storage: Your to-do list is saved in local storage, so your tasks are retained between sessions.

**How It Works**
To add a new task, simply enter a description in the input field and press "Add Task."<br>
You can edit a task by clicking the "Edit" button or delete it by clicking the "Delete" button.<br>
Your to-do list is automatically saved to local storage, so your tasks will persist even if you close and reopen the app.
